# Cypress API Testing Practice

##Setup
In this project we are using Cypress to test Rest APIs using our own [Fake JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/zeinkap/cypress-api-testing-practice/).
We are using Cypress version 12 and the cypress-plugin-api to display API calls in the Cypress TestRunner UI
All data (comments, posts and profiles) are stored in the db.json file.

##CI/CD
Integrated with GiHub Actions as part of CI/CD pipeline.
