# cypress-api-testing-practice
In this project we are using Cypress to test APIs using our own fake JSON Server located at:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/zeinkap/cypress-api-testing-practice/

We are currently using Cypress version 12 and the cypress-plugin-api to display API calls in the Cypress TestRunner UI.

Integrated with GiHub Actions as part of CI/CD pipeline.
